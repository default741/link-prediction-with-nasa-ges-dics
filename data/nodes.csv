The rationale of the project is to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes.PET is estimated using three methods: Penman open-water method (Penman), Priestley-Taylor method (PT), Reference crop evapotranspiration using the UN Food and Agricultural Organization approach (FAO). The Penman equation assumes PET occurs from an open water surface and calculates PET based on observations of surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Shuttleworth, 1993). The PT equation calculates PET based on surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature and does not account for the aerodynamic component (Priestley and Taylor, 1972).

It provides an annual average of a global planetary boundary layer (PBL) height climatology derived from the COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 and TerraSAR-X Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements from June 2006 to December 2015. The COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission consists of a six-satellite constellation launched in 2006.  Each satellite carries the IGOR GPS receiver and is equipped with fore and aft looking antenna to track both setting and rising occultations.  The constellation provides globally distributed measurements across different local times.  The TerraSAR-X (TSX) is a X-band SAR imaging satellite with GPS RO being a secondary measurement.  It also carries an IGOR receiver and has been collecting GPS RO measurements since 2011.  The instrument tracks the L-band microwave signal broadcast by a GPS satellite in a limb-viewing geometry. The IGOR receivers on COSMIC and TSX are capable of tracking the GPS signals in open loop through the middle to lower troposphere, which is essential for obtaining data with high quality for PBL height estimation, especially at low latitudes.  The refractivity profiles from COSMIC and TSX form the basis for this PBL height product.For each occultation, the PBL height is calculated as the height where the vertical gradient of the refractivity (dN/dz) is minimum.  This algorithm is designed to locate the height where a large vertical change in refractivity occurs, corresponding to the transition from the free troposphere to the PBL.   More details can be found in Ao et al. (2012).  Each PBL height is associated with a time (starting time of the occultation) and location (latitude and longitude of the tangent point at the minimum altitude).  The PBL height data are then binned into 2 degree x 2 degree latitude/longitude regions and averaged to produce the mean and standard deviation values in the climatology products.  The refractivity profile has a vertical resolution of about 200 m and represents an along path horizontal averaging of ~100 km.  Thus, occultations with tangent points near the coast may represent averaging over both land and ocean and should be interpreted with care. The refractivity gradient method used here is not the only method that can be used to estimate the PBL height.  Other algorithms have been proposed, including looking at ""breakpoint"" instead of minimum gradient, wavelet covariance transform, and using variables like bending angles or specific humidity instead of refractivity.  However, the basic principle is the same.  The difference between the different algorithms is small where the PBL is well-defined, with a strong capping inversion.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPS Radio Occultation Boundary Layer Depth Annual L3 V1 (GPSROZPBLA) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '6c8c5b3c-d3b5-5f86-a875-8f3f786b0bb1', 'shortName': 'GPSROZPBLA', 'doi': '10.5067/4XKM9DCKEB5K'}"

The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)+ MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM.

Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions.

These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by the current version.The 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) + MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible.

This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria: 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month. 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band. 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'SBUV2/NOAA-16 Ozone (O3) Profile and Total Column Ozone 1 Month Zonal Mean L3 Global 5.0 degree Latitude Zones V1 (SBUV2N16L3zm) at GES DISC', 'globalId': 'b01f53f8-17dc-55f5-a90d-442afa9277a1', 'shortName': 'SBUV2N16L3zm', 'doi': '10.5067/MEASURES/OZONE/DATA306'}"

129,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  Late Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDL) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHL. The derived result represents a Late expedited estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHL and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived late daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHL for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHL is 12 hours, the daily should appear about 12 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHL), please see the Documentation (Related URL).  In the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:""Early"" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and""Late"" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphingand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:""Final"", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.The following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                Pdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}where:Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)Pi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)Nf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=481[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwisePdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.On occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the ""true"" daily total. These events are easily detectable using ""counts"" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:Perr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )where:Perr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)Ncnt_err\t- The counts for the error variableThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)This estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPM IMERG Late Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (GPM_3IMERGDL) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '9a2d07f5-9e8b-5066-ac8b-5fb2768ae7a2', 'shortName': 'GPM_3IMERGDL', 'doi': '10.5067/GPM/IMERGDL/DAY/06'}"

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.

(1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.Estimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.The method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The CSH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR.

However, the instrument data are characterized by large gaps in coverage due to OCO-2’s narrow 10-km ground track and an inability to see through clouds and thick aerosols. This global gridded dataset is produced using a data assimilation technique commonly referred to as state estimation within the geophysical literature. Data assimilation synthesizes simulations and observations, adjusting the state of atmospheric constituents like CO2 to reflect observed values, thus gap-filling observations when and where they are unavailable based on previous observations and short transport simulations by GEOS. Compared to other methods, data assimilation has the advantage that it makes estimates based on our collective scientific understanding, notably of the Earth’s carbon cycle and atmospheric transport.  OCO-2 GEOS (Goddard Earth Observing System) Level 3 data are produced by ingesting OCO-2 L2 retrievals every 6 hours with GEOS CoDAS, a modeling and data assimilation system maintained by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO).

192,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided.

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz. The CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.This daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying profile level specific quality control (QC). Specific QC is defined per retrieved geophysical parameter at a given level within a profile. It accepts profile level data from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC algorithm determines that the retrieval is good. Below this level, the data is rejected. Specific QC is designed to maximize the yield of each variable.

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.

Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty."", 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPM SSM/I on F13 (GPROF) Climate-based Radiometer Precipitation Profiling L2 1.5 hours 12 km V07 (GPM_2AGPROFF13SSMI_CLIM) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '8d08db07-d1f0-5e22-b5f6-447cb6a68452', 'shortName': 'GPM_2AGPROFF13SSMI_CLIM', 'doi': '10.5067/GPM/SSMI/F13/GPROFCLIM/2A/07'}"

The bolometers were thermally isolated from but in close proximity to reflecting mirrors so that the hemispheres behaved like isolated spheres in space. The experiment was designed to measure the amount of solar energy absorbed, reflected, and emitted by the earth and its atmosphere in order to calculate the Earth's radiation budget.

279,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'This data set contains the primary forcing data ""File A"" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing data sets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). The non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR andNLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are those employed in NLDAS-1, as presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).The surface downward shortwave radiation field in ""File A"" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in ""File A"" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).The precipitation field in ""File A"" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in ""File A"" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in ""File B""): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.The hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files, ""File A"" and ""File B"".  ""File A"" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven fields.  The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units.

298,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'Version 07 is the current version of the data set. The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A&B), ATMS (SNPP and NOAA-20). This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

309,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.

The 2AKa algorithm provides precipitation estimates from the Ka radar of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar on the core GPM spacecraft. The product contains two swaths of data corresponding to the scans of the Ka radar. The first swath contains matched scans (MS), which are intended to be co-aligned with the Ku-band instantaneous fields of view (IFOV). The second swath contains the high-sensitivity scans (HS), which are interleaved between the Ku/Ka-MS swaths. Both swaths are narrow and centered within the interior of the Ku swath. This is a single-frequency retrieval of precipitation; no information from the Ku radar is used. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar IFOV for each swath.\t   This is a single-frequency retrieval that relies on Ka-band data only. While the dual-frequency retrieval should give better overall estimates, that algorithm requires co-aligned Ku-band data. This 2AKa product will be produced independently and would not be impacted by any operational issues with the Ku-band radar. The high sensitivity to smaller hydrometeors should result in precipitation estimates in lighter precipitation then the Ku-only data.

Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 9r.This data set is currently provided by the OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) Project. In expectation of the OCO-2 launch, the algorithm was developed by the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) Task as a preparatory project, using GOSAT TANSO-FTS spectra. After the OCO-2 launch,  ""ACOS"" data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.The ""ACOS"" data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.The GOSAT team at JAXA produces GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level 1B (L1B) data products for internal use and for distribution to collaborative partners, such as ESA and NASA. These calibrated products are augmented by the OCO Project with additional geolocation information and further corrections. Thus produced Level 1B products (with calibrated radiances and geolocation) are the input to the ""ACOS"" Level 2 production process.Even though the GES DISC is not publicly distributing Level 1B ACOS products, it should be known that changes in this version are affecting both Level 1B and Level 2 data. An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings. Elimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band.

Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07.The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A&B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible.

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.This data product, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree monthly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 19, 2019.  The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year.

Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.The precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme. The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively.

430,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team. Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the final estimate of the Daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHH and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. In the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:""Early"" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and""Late"" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphingand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:""Final"", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.The following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                Pdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}where:Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)Pi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)Nf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=481[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwisePdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.On occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the ""true"" daily total. These events are easily detectable using ""counts"" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:Perr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )where:Perr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)Ncnt_err\t- The counts for the error variableThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)This estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (GPM_3IMERGDF) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '1de0d747-a057-5f0c-83ce-88b9ea518384', 'shortName': 'GPM_3IMERGDF', 'doi': '10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/06'}"

Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes).

These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible.

The rationale of the project is to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes.PET is estimated using three methods: Penman open-water method (Penman), Priestley-Taylor method (PT), Reference crop evapotranspiration using the UN Food and Agricultural Organization approach (FAO). The Penman equation assumes PET occurs from an open water surface and calculates PET based on observations of surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Shuttleworth, 1993). The PT equation calculates PET based on surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature and does not account for the aerodynamic component (Priestley and Taylor, 1972). The FAO equation is a specific application of the Penman-Monteith equation for crop and short-grass reference surfaces and is based on surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Allen, 1998).  As a follow-on to PET_PU_3H025 Version 1, PET_PU_3H025 Version 2 seeks to continue to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes. The modifications include the addition of the FAO tall reference crop equation, an extension of the radiation data and temporal coverage, the usage of the GLASS satellite albedo to estimate upward short-wave radiation and the estimation of ground heat flux based on diurnal phase shift of net radiation.This second version of the dataset is estimated at a 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0.25x0.25 degrees spatial resolution globally, spanning the 33-year period 1984-2016.

486,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'TMPA (3B42_Daily) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG dataset (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/06).This daily accumulated precipitation product is generated from the research-quality 3-hourly TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis TMPA (3B42). It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes. Counts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.Efforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format.The information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.The following describes the derivation in more details.The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                Pdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}where:Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)Pi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)Nf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=81[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwisePdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.On occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the ""true"" daily total. These events are easily detectable using ""counts"" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:Perr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )where:Perr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)Ncnt_err\t- The counts for the error variableThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, accumulates first within the 3-hour period of the source data, and then continues to accumulate during the day. These values, however, can easily be converted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)This estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'TRMM (TMPA) Precipitation L3 1 day 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree V7 (TRMM_3B42_Daily) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '7fcd4e43-ad1a-5455-9a9d-1332a901bddc', 'shortName': 'TRMM_3B42_Daily', 'doi': '10.5067/TRMM/TMPA/DAY/7'}"

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.This data product, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree monthly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 19, 2019.  The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update.  In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 0.25 x 0.25 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_NOAH025_M) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '6b2c969b-6191-5d7a-839e-acdefe46f02d', 'shortName': 'GLDAS_NOAH025_M', 'doi': '10.5067/9SQ1B3ZXP2C5'}"

In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.The thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts.

The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A;B;C), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.

It provides seasonal averages of a global planetary boundary layer (PBL) height climatology derived from the COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 and TerraSAR-X Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements from June 2006 to December 2015. The COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission consists of a six-satellite constellation launched in 2006.  Each satellite carries the IGOR GPS receiver and is equipped with fore and aft looking antenna to track both setting and rising occultations.  The constellation provides globally distributed measurements across different local times.  The TerraSAR-X (TSX) is a X-band SAR imaging satellite with GPS RO being a secondary measurement.  It also carries an IGOR receiver and has been collecting GPS RO measurements since 2011.  The instrument tracks the L-band microwave signal broadcast by a GPS satellite in a limb-viewing geometry. The IGOR receivers on COSMIC and TSX are capable of tracking the GPS signals in open loop through the middle to lower troposphere, which is essential for obtaining data with high quality for PBL height estimation, especially at low latitudes.  The refractivity profiles from COSMIC and TSX form the basis for this PBL height product.For each occultation, the PBL height is calculated as the height where the vertical gradient of the refractivity (dN/dz) is minimum.  This algorithm is designed to locate the height where a large vertical change in refractivity occurs, corresponding to the transition from the free troposphere to the PBL.   More details can be found in Ao et al. (2012).  Each PBL height is associated with a time (starting time of the occultation) and location (latitude and longitude of the tangent point at the minimum altitude).  The PBL height data are then binned into 2 degree x 2 degree latitude/longitude regions and averaged to produce the mean and standard deviation values in the climatology products.  The refractivity profile has a vertical resolution of about 200 m and represents an along path horizontal averaging of ~100 km.  Thus, occultations with tangent points near the coast may represent averaging over both land and ocean and should be interpreted with care. The refractivity gradient method used here is not the only method that can be used to estimate the PBL height.  Other algorithms have been proposed, including looking at ""breakpoint"" instead of minimum gradient, wavelet covariance transform, and using variables like bending angles or specific humidity instead of refractivity.  However, the basic principle is the same.  The difference between the different algorithms is small where the PBL is well-defined, with a strong capping inversion.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPS Radio Occultation Boundary Layer Depth Seasonal L3 V1 (GPSROZPBLS) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '0b9a3287-9bae-5617-999f-402fbeb3e2b6', 'shortName': 'GPSROZPBLS', 'doi': '10.5067/XGL1QBKFBI5B'}"

Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM).

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.2 is new to the GES DISC archive and currently includes a main product from CLSM-F2.5 with Data Assimilation for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-DA) from February 2003 to present.  The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb\'s, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb\'s trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb\'s by genuinely removing the ""artifactitious"" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb\'s has been completed very recently. GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb\'s (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful ""Rice Cooker Theory"" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., ""To produce a good and trustworthy \'output product\' (delicious \'cooked rice\') depends not only on a well-functioned \'model/algorithm\' (\'rice cooker\'), but also on a genuine and reliable \'input data\' (\'raw rice\') with good quality"" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.            This is the Monthly product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. The monthly product is a result of averaging of a month worth of daily GSSTF2c files. Starting with Version 2c, there is only one set of Combined data, ""Set1"".  A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz. The CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.The monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the specific quality control (QC) methodology to form a level-2 daily gridded product. Specific QC is defined per retrieved geophysical parameter at a given level within a profile. It accepts profile level data from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC algorithm determines that the retrieval is good. Below this level, the data is rejected. This is the same methodology used by the AIRS Version 6 processing system. The daily level-3 gridded products are averaged to create the monthly average. The CHART system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system.

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).

The 1B21 calculates the received power at the PR receiver input point from the Level-0 count value which is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the PR receiver output power. To convert the count value to the input power, extensive internal calibrations are applied, which are mainly based upon the system model, temperature dependence of model parameters and many temperature sensors attached at various locations of the PR. Periodically the input-output characteristics are measured using an internal calibration loop for the IF unit and later receiver stages. To make an absolute calibration, an Active Radar Calibrator (ARC) is placed at Kansai Branch of CRL and overall system gain of the PR is being measured every 2 months.  Using the transfer function based on the above internal and external calibrations, the PR received power is obtained.

672,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center generate groundwater and soil moisture drought indicators each week. They are based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE satellite data and integrated with other observations, using a sophisticated numerical model of land surface water and energy processes.This data product is GRACE Data Assimilation for Drought Monitoring (GRACE-DA-DM) U.S. Version 4.0 data product and supersedes the GRACE-DA-DM Version 2.0. The GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 is based on the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) Fortuna 2.5 version simulation that was created within the Land Information System data assimilation framework (Kumar et al., 2016). This simulation used the latest GRACE RL06 (GRACE; 2002-2017) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE-FO; 2018-present) Mascon solutions version 2, at 0.25 degree resolution, from the University of Texas at Austin (Save et al., 2016; Save, 2020). The CLSM soil parameters were updated to address a soil moisture dry limit issue found near Zapata, Texas. Because the root zone soil moisture frequently reaches the dry limit there, drought conditions are often “normal” when the area should be in drought. The new soil parameters resolved the issue, and the root zone soil moisture now matches closely the in-situ observation near Zapata. In the data assimilation, the baseline for Terrestrial Water Storage anomaly computation was updated to the 2003-2019 mean, whereas previous simulations used the 2003-2016 mean. The percentile computation was switched to a 7-day moving average climatology, instead of monthly, to improve the temporal transition of drought/wetness conditions.The GRACE-DA-DM V1.0 was created by the stand alone CLSM (an older version) using the GRACE-Tellus 1 degree data from the Center for Space Research at University of Texas. The GRACE data assimilation (DA) is executed on a grid-to-grid basis in V2.0, while a basin scale average was used in V1.0 (Zaitchik et al. 2008). The V2.0 data were reprocessed (on June 14, 2017), using the GRACE RL05 Mascon solutions version 1 data set from UT CSR, for the entire period from April 1, 2002 to June 5, 2017. The reprocessing included fixes in the DA and increased the bedrock depth by 3 meters to enhance the drought indicator calculations. The GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 uses the same configuration as the V2.0 for the DA scheme and increased bedrock depth, with the updates previously mentioned, thus supersedes the previous versions. The GRACE-DA-DM U.S. V4.0 data product contains three drought indicators: Groundwater Percentile, Root Zone Soil Moisture Percentile, and Surface Soil Moisture Percentile. These drought indicators express wet or dry conditions as a percentile, indicating the probability of occurrence within the period of record from 1948 to 2014. The drought indicator data are daily, but available only one day (Monday) per week.

The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2000-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.Cloud clearing is the process of computing the clear column radiance for a given channel n, and represents what the channel would have observed if the entire scene were cloud free. The entire scene is defined as the ATMS field of regard (FOR) which includes and array of 3x3 CrIS field of views (FOV). The basic assumption of cloud-clearing is that if the observed radiances in each field-of-view are different, the differences in the observed radiances are solely attributed to the differences in the fractional cloudiness in each field of view while everything else (surface properties and atmospheric state) is uniform across the field of regard.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) + MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

Pentads always start on the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st, and 26th days of the month and may contain as few as 3 days of data or as much as 6 days. They preserve the multivariate distributional features of the original data and so provide a compressed data set that more accurately describes the disparate atmospheric states that is in the original Level-2 swath data set.

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. This suite of GSSTF version 3 products is the 0.25x0.25 deg resolution version of the GSSTF 2c collections. It does not contain, however, the ""WB"" variable - \'lowest 500-m precipitable water\' (g/cm**2). This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 0.25  degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 1440x720 size. As in previous versions, the daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the ""final"" GSSTF, Version 3, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.            There are only one set of GSSTF, Version 3, Combined data, ""Set1""              The ""individual"" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:      GSSTF_Fxx_3, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)            The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP].

719,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'This dataset (TOVSAMNA) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-6 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).These Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format.

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb\'s, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb\'s trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb\'s by genuinely removing the ""artifactitious"" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb\'s has been completed very recently. GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb\'s (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful ""Rice Cooker Theory"" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., ""To produce a good and trustworthy \'output product\' (delicious \'cooked rice\') depends not only on a well-functioned \'model/algorithm\' (\'rice cooker\'), but also on a genuine and reliable \'input data\' (\'raw rice\') with good quality"" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.

732,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided.

The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A&B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

742,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'This is the Gridded Monthly OCO-2 Carbon Dioxide assimilated dataset.  The OCO-2 mission provides the highest quality space-based XCO2 retrievals to date. However, the instrument data are characterized by large gaps in coverage due to OCO-2’s narrow 10-km ground track and an inability to see through clouds and thick aerosols. This global gridded dataset is produced using a data assimilation technique commonly referred to as state estimation within the geophysical literature. Data assimilation synthesizes simulations and observations, adjusting the state of atmospheric constituents like CO2 to reflect observed values, thus gap-filling observations when and where they are unavailable based on previous observations and short transport simulations by GEOS. Compared to other methods, data assimilation has the advantage that it makes estimates based on our collective scientific understanding, notably of the Earth’s carbon cycle and atmospheric transport.  OCO-2 GEOS (Goddard Earth Observing System) Level 3 data are produced by ingesting OCO-2 L2 retrievals every 6 hours with GEOS CoDAS, a modeling and data assimilation system maintained by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO).

779,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.  Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided.

The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)+ MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty"", 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPM AMSU-B on NOAA15 (GPROF) Climate-based Radiometer Precipitation Profiling L2 1.5 hours 16 km V07 (GPM_2AGPROFNOAA15AMSUB) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '5efa3db7-6d7c-50c3-8a92-db186832d041', 'shortName': 'GPM_2AGPROFNOAA15AMSUB_CLIM', 'doi': '10.5067/GPM/AMSUB/NOAA15/GPROFCLIM/2A/07'}"

(1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).These Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.The 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)+ MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Early* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE. The derived result represents an early (expedited) estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHE and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived Early daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHE for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHE is 4 hours, the daily should appear about 4 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHE), please see the Documentation (Related URL). In the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:""Early"" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and""Late"" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphingand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:""Final"", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.The following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                Pdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}where:Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)Pi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)Nf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=481[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwisePdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.On occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the ""true"" daily total. These events are easily detectable using ""counts"" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt less than  Nf.There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:Perr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )where:Perr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)Ncnt_err\t- The counts for the error variableThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:rms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)This estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPM IMERG Early Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (GPM_3IMERGDE) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '9ee11ec2-9e5e-5737-bfd4-79e5f28ba27f', 'shortName': 'GPM_3IMERGDE', 'doi': '10.5067/GPM/IMERGDE/DAY/06'}"

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.This data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.The 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.

The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency\'s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.

Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables.

850,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'This dataset (TOVSAMNC) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-7 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).These Level 3 monthly mean products are in netCDF format.

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products. GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. This data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.The monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation.

The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.

896,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'This dataset (TOVSAMND) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-12 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process.

For each column observation location, the receptors are located at 14 discrete vertical levels throughout the atmospheric column.

Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided.

For this product there are 53 months of data from March 2009 through July 2013. There are a total of 36 latitudinal bands, 18 in each hemisphere.

The MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions: 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees). 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle > 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).NOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.The zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria: 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month. 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band. 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'SBUV2/NOAA-19 Ozone (O3) Profile and Total Column Ozone 1 Month Zonal Mean L3 Global 5.0 degree Latitude Zones V1 (SBUV2N19L3zm) at GES DISC', 'globalId': 'ce8ba20f-fd56-59e9-a926-42e7c786a8fd', 'shortName': 'SBUV2N19L3zm', 'doi': '10.5067/MEASURES/OZONE/DATA309'}"

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.Estimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.The method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The SLH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the SLH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.The Gridded Orbital Spectral Latent Heating is actually one orbit gridded onto a global map with  0.5 degree x 0.5 degree grid cell size.

Cloud-Cleared Radiances contain calibrated, geolocated channel-by-channel AIRS infrared radiances (milliWatts/m2/cm-1/steradian) that would have been observed within each AMSU footprint if there were no clouds in the FOV and produced along with the AIRS Standard Product, as they are the radiances used to retrieve the Standard Product. Nevertheless, they are an order of magnitude larger in data volume than the remainder of the Standard Products and, many Standard Product users are expected to have little interest in the Cloud Cleared Radiance. For these reasons they are a separate output file.

The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A;B;C), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files).The non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and NLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).The surface downward shortwave radiation field in ""File A"" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in ""File A"" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).The precipitation field in ""File A"" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in ""File A"" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in ""File B""): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.The hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, ""File A"" and ""File B"". ""File A"" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields. Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2.0 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012).

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).

1027,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. This data product is for GLDAS-2.1 Catchment monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the Catchment-F2.5 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.  The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency\'s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. This data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency\'s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.The precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:""Early"" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and""Late"" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphingand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:""Final"", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.Briefly describing the Final Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then ""forward/backward morphed"" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with seasonal GPCP SG surface precipitation data to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe.

The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products.

Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) + MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.The precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.The half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme. The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.The IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:""Early"" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and""Late"" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphingand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:""Final"", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.Currently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.Briefly describing the Early Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then ""forward morphed"" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields to provide half-hourly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe.

The COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission consists of a six-satellite constellation launched in 2006.  Each satellite carries an Integrated GPS Occultation Receiver (IGOR) GPS receiver and is equipped with fore and aft looking antenna to track both setting and rising occultations.  The constellation provides globally distributed measurements across different local times.  The instrument tracks the L-band microwave signal broadcast by a GPS satellite in a limb-viewing geometry. The IGOR receivers are capable of tracking the GPS signals in open loop through the middle to lower troposphere, which is essential for obtaining data with high quality for PBL height estimation, especially at low latitudes.  The refractivity profiles form the basis for this PBL height product. For each occultation, the PBL height is calculated as the height where the vertical gradient of the refractivity (dN/dz) is minimum.

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz. The CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. Cloud clearing is the process of computing the clear column radiance for a given channel n, and represents what the channel would have observed if the entire scene were cloud free. The entire scene is defined as the ATMS field of regard (FOR) which includes and array of 3x3 CrIS field of views (FOV). The basic assumption of cloud-clearing is that if the observed radiances in each field-of-view are different, the differences in the observed radiances are solely attributed to the differences in the fractional cloudiness in each field of view while everything else (surface properties and atmospheric state) is uniform across the field of regard.The CHART system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system. For comparison, the AIRS/AMSU data collection AIRI2CCR contains similar meteorological information to this CHART data collection and the CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) data collection SNDRSNIML2CCPCCRN contains CRIMSS data processed with an analogous algorithm.

The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A&B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.

Cloud-Cleared Radiances contain calibrated, geolocated channel-by-channel AIRS infrared radiances (milliWatts/m2/cm-1/steradian) that would have been observed within each AMSU footprint if there were no clouds in the FOV and produced along with the AIRS Standard Product, as they are the radiances used to retrieve the Standard Product. Nevertheless, they are an order of magnitude larger in data volume than the remainder of the Standard Products, and many Standard Product users are expected to have little interest in the Cloud Cleared Radiance. For these reasons they are a separate output file, but like the Standard Product, are generated at all locations.An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track for each of the approximate 2378 channels. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'Aqua/AIRS L2 Cloud-Cleared Infrared Radiances (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC', 'globalId': 'a0df7ac7-39a7-5a7b-a131-a62c11303bf8', 'shortName': 'AIRS2CCF', 'doi': '10.5067/MJ8L3K55HMZJ'}"

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STD. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day.

The product is based on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center principal component analysis (PCA) spectral fitting algorithm (Li et al., 2013, 2017), and continues (Zhang et al., 2017) NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) standard Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument SO2 product (OMSO2). The latest OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product uses new Jacobian lookup tables and more realistic model based a priori profiles in anthropogenic SO2 retrievals. This helps to more accurately account for the pixel-to-pixel variation in SO2 sensitivity due to different factors such as the vertical distribution of SO2, solar and viewing angles, surface reflectivity, and cloudiness. As compared with the previous OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V1.2 product that assumes the same SO2 sensitivity for all OMPS pixels, the new V2 anthropogenic SO2 retrievals have reduced retrieval biases especially over background regions (see Figure 1 for an example). The same updated PCA SO2 retrieval algorithm (Li et al., 2020) is also used to produce the recently released OMSO2 V2 product (doi:10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022).

Where SO2 remains near the Earth's surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality.

The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1C data set contains AIRS infrared calibrated and geolocated radiances in W/m2/micron/ster. This data set is generated from AIRS level 1B data. The spectral coverage of L1C data is from 3.74 to 15.4 mm. The nominal spectral resolution lambda / delta lambda = 1200. The spectrum is sampled twice per spectral resolution element in a total of 2645 spectral channels. A day of AIRS data is divided into 240 granules (scenes) each of 6-minute duration. For the AIRS IR measurements, an individual granule contains 135 pixels across-track and 90 along-track pixels; there are total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 pixels per granule. AIRS employs a 49.5 degree crosstrack scanning with a 1.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to provide twice daily coverage of essentially the entire globe in a 1:30 PM sun synchronous orbit with the 13.5 x 13.5 km2 spatial resolution at nadir.

1162,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'Version 07 is the current version of the data set. The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A&B), ATMS (SNPP and NOAA-21). This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  This data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version. The monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency&#8217;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables.

1181,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning 2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.  IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).  While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH.  The derived result represents the Final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions before ""07"", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the combined microwave-infrared and rain gauge  dataset, variable ""precipitation"",  and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global ""precipitation"" data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable ""MWprecipitation"", where the occurrence of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable, and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version ""07"", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. The latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. The daily mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour) in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for every grid cell we have                Pdaily_mean     = SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]} / Pdaily_cnt  * 24, i=[1,Nf]Where:Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}Pi              - half-hourly input, in (mm/hr)Nf              - Number of half-hourly files per day, Nf=481[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwisePdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.Pdaily_cnt are provided in the data files as variables ""precipitation_cnt"" and ""MWprecipitation_cnt"", for correspondingly the microwave-IR-gauge and microwave-only retrievals. They are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. There are various ways the daily error could be estimated from the source half-hourly random error (variable ""randomError""). The daily error provided in the data files is calculated in a fashion similar to the daily mean precipitation rate. First, the mean of the squared half-hourly ""randomError""  for the day is computed, and the resulting (mm^2/hr) is converted to (mm^2/day). Finally, square root is taken to get the result in (mm/day):Perr_daily = { SUM{ (Perr_i)^2 * 1[Perr_i valid] ) } / Ncnt_err  * 24}^0.5, i=[1,Nf]Ncnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )where:Perr_i\t\t- half-hourly input, ""randomError"", (mm/hr)Perr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily error, (mm/day)Ncnt_err\t\t- Number of valid half-hour error estimatesAgain, the sum of squared ""randomError"" can be reconstructed, and other estimates can be derived using the available counts in the Daily files.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGDF) at GES DISC', 'globalId': '1babdf08-d516-553a-9008-a563f1c07e37', 'shortName': 'GPM_3IMERGDF', 'doi': '10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/07'}"

Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). Mosaic was developed by Koster and Suarez (1994, 1996) to account for subgrid vegetation variability with a tile approach. Each vegetation tile carries its own energy and water balance and soil moisture and temperature.  Each tile has three soil layers, with the first two in the root zone. In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160 cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200 cm).

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions.

The CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data.

The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011). However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb\'s, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb\'s trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb\'s by genuinely removing the ""artifactitious"" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb\'s has been completed very recently. GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb\'s (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful ""Rice Cooker Theory"" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., ""To produce a good and trustworthy \'output product\' (delicious \'cooked rice\') depends not only on a well-functioned \'model/algorithm\' (\'rice cooker\'), but also on a genuine and reliable \'input data\' (\'raw rice\') with good quality"" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.

1202,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'This dataset (TOVSAMTN) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from TIROS-N and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloud top height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).These Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites.

Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07.The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&19, METOP A&B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions.

The CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.The monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the comprehensive quality control (QC) methodology to form a level-2 daily gridded product. The daily level-3 gridded products are averaged to create the monthly average. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.

Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes).

The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary).

TOMSN7SO2 is a Level 2 orbital swath product, which will be used to study the fifteen-year SO2 record from the Nimbus-7 TOMS and to expand the historical database of known volcanic eruptions. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels.

1221,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-2c (GSSTF2c) Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. GSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb\'s, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb\'s trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb\'s by genuinely removing the ""artifactitious"" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb\'s has been completed very recently. GSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb\'s (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful ""Rice Cooker Theory"" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., ""To produce a good and trustworthy \'output product\' (delicious \'cooked rice\') depends not only on a well-functioned \'model/algorithm\' (\'rice cooker\'), but also on a genuine and reliable \'input data\' (\'raw rice\') with good quality"" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. This is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3. The GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15). Then, the Combined daily fluxes are produced by averaging (equally weighted) over available flux data/files from various satellites.  These Combined daily flux data are considered as the ""final"" GSSTF, Version 2c, and are stored in this HDF-EOS5 collection.      There are only one set of GSSTF, Version 2c, Combined data, ""Set1""             The ""individual"" daily flux data files, produced for each individual satellite, are also available in HDF-EOS5, although from different collections:      GSSTF_Fxx_2c, where Fxx are the individual satellites (F08, F10, etc..)            The input data sets used for this recent GSSTF production include the upgraded and improved datasets such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) Version-6 (V6) product of brightness temperature [Tb], total precipitable water [W], and wind speed [U] produced by the Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), as well as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis-2 (R2) product of sea skin temperature [SKT], 2-meter air temperature [Tair], and sea level pressure [SLP].

(1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).These Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. The ""CLIM""  products differ from their ""regular"" counterparts (without the ""CLIM"" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)+ MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM\'s constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM\'s core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions.

The CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data.

(1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process.

They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the ""CLIM"" output. The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to modeldata) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines.

Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The CSH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.Because observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the CSH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.The Gridded Orbital Spectral Latent Heating is actually one orbit gridded onto a global map with  0.25x0.25 degree grid cell size.

Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.

It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). Although the grid is from 60S to 60N, the high latitudes (beyond 50S/N) near real-time retrievals are considered very unreliable and thus are screened out from the daily accumulations. The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes.  Counts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.Efforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format. The latency of this derived daily product is about 7 hours after the UTC day is closed. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.The information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.The following describes the derivation in more details.The daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                Pdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]Pdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}where:Pdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)Pi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)Nf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=81[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwisePdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.Grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.Note that Pi=0 is a valid value.On occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the ""true"" daily total. These events are easily detectable using ""counts"" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.There are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken.

(1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.The Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).These Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period.

They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:+ TMI (TRMM)+ GMI, (GPM)+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) + MHS (METOP A,B)+ ATMS (NPP)+ SAPHIR (MT1)This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible.

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.This data product, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree 3-hourly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 27, 2019.  The data product contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.The GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.', 'daac': 'NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC', 'longName': 'GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 3 hourly 0.25 x 0.25 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_NOAH025_3H) at GES DISC', 'globalId': 'af89d1f6-f095-51fb-8feb-2ac3f1cd6157', 'shortName': 'GLDAS_NOAH025_3H', 'doi': '10.5067/342OHQM9AK6Q'}"

1280,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'These data originate from NOAA/NCEP.The NOAA Climate Prediction Center/NCEP/NWS is making the data available originally in binary format, in a weekly rotating archive. The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become available, converts them into CF (Climate and Forecast) -convention compliant netCDF-4 format, and stores the product in a permanent archive. It has been the intention to extend the record back to TRMM epoch, and some data are available from 1998. However, currently, the continuous record starts from February, 2000.The leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT data providers).The data contain  globally-merged (60S-60N) 4-km pixel-resolution IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European, Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16, METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8).The data have been corrected for ""zenith angle dependence"", i.e. IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects.  This correction allows for the merging of the IR data from the various geostationary satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at their boundaries.  Some residual differences among the data exist since the IR channels aboard the various spacecraft have slightly different characteristics and no intercalibration among the sensors has been performed. NOAA are in the process of performing such an intercalibration, although this effect is considerably smaller than the zenith angle effects. As well, parallax correction is applied, which shifts the geo-location of the GEO-IR footprints to approximately account for the cloud tops being displaced away from their actual geographic location when viewed along a slanted path.The NASA GES DISC is curating these data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4 data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats using the OPeNDAP interface. Similarities with the original-----------------------------As in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution. Differences from the original-----------------------------1. The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4 format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of their machines. 2. To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata, the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East). It is also starting from -60 (South).The data and time units are reflected in the corresponding ""units"" attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude (""lon""), latitude (""lat"") and ""time"" vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple ""ncdump"" or ""h5dump"" command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.Acknowledgements------------------The creation of the original data at NOAA/NCEP is supported by funding from the NOAA Office of Global Programs for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and by NASA via the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).

The CrIS instrument used for this product is deployed on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and uses the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer  with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions.The NH3 L2 ammonia algorithm is based on an AER (Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc.) program initially developed to process TES (Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer) trace gas products. This version runs within the ESSPA software framework: it uses the AER OSS forward model and an optimal estimation approach with a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Temperature and water profiles are obtained from the CLIMCAPS Field of Regard (FOR) products, as are initial guesses for surface temperature and emissivity. The algorithm consists of a two-step sequential retrieval the first step retrieves surface temperature and emissivity and the second step an ammonia profile. The algorithm produces ammonia retrievals on every field of view (FOV) in each FOR.A level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints crosstrack by 45 lines along track.

1294,['Dataset'],"{'abstract': 'NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are ""open-loop"" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. This data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.The GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency\'s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.In October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.If you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.

The data will trace an elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic pattern on the ground due to the rotating of the instrument about the satellite spin axis. There is one orbit per file. The data were originally written on IBM 7094 machines, and these have been recovered from magnetic tapes, referred to as the Final Meteorological Radiation Tapes (FMRT). The data are archived in their original IBM 36-bit word proprietary format, also referred to as a binary TAP file.The TIROS-2 satellite was successfully launched on November 23, 1960. The Medium-Resolution Scanning Radiometer experiment successfully returned data for about five months, becoming the first radiometer to make meteorlogical measurements from space. Three follow-on instruments were flown on TIROS-3, -4 and -7. Initially, all channels performed normally. However, channels 1 and 4 gradually deteriorated and by January 1961 were useless. The signal to noise ratio of channels 3 and 5 was extremely low, and the output was highly questionable. The instrument is a five channel radiometer with a 55 km footprint at nadir with the following characteristics:Channel 1: 6.0 to 6.5 microns - water vapor absorptionChannel 2: 8.0 to 12.0 microns - atmospheric windowChannel 3: 0.2 to 6.0 microns - reflected solar radiationChannel 4: 8.0 to 30 microns - terrestial radiationChannel 5: 0.55 to 0.75 microns - response to the TV systemThe Principal Investigator for these data was Joseph D.
